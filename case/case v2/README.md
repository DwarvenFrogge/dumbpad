# Printing Settings:
I use a Flying Bear Ghost 5 with a 0.4mm nozzle.

## File: dumbpad_lid.stl
Horizontal Hole Expansion:
Adjust the horizontal hole expansion parameter in Cura or a similar slicer. Recommended values range from -1.6 to -0.2.
## File: 6mm_split_shaft_pot_knob_12mm.stl
Horizontal Hole Expansion:
The required adjustment depends on the type of filament used to ensure a snug fit of the knob on the shaft without wobbling. Alternatively, a 6mm drill bit can be used for precise fitting.
## Mounting the PCB:
 Use 4 M2x5mm bolts to secure the PCB to the case. Alternatively, other bolt sizes can be used by adjusting the horizontal hole expansion settings accordingly.
