# Dumbpad Case

based off the original design by Anthony @ [customkbd.com.au](https://customkbd.com/collections/cases/products/dumbpad-3d-printed-highcase) - huge thanks to him for his initial work and sending me the STL files I used to create a batch through Shapeways

Files also available on [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4816442)

## Changes from Anthony's design

Main difference is some tabs added in the corners to support the PCB a little better.

I found the original design flexed quite a bit, especially when pressing the rotary encoder. This design aims to fix that.

Also removed some material under the Pro Micro USB port to prevent stress on the port if the Pro Micro is soldered directly to the PCB.

## Redesigned using SketchUp because

1. I suck at any other 3d modeling software
1. I've used it before
1. It was literally quicker to redraw the whole thing in SketchUp than try to learn a new tool.

### dumbpad_case

Basic case.

### dumbpad_case_emboss

Same as dumbpad_case with "dumbpad" emboss on the rear face.
